So let's set up the environment you will need

##1. Installing Python on Windows
Python doesn’t come preinstalled on Windows. You need to download and install in manually. 
You can follow this [guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/) to download Python 2.7. You can also install the latest version (3.5) from their [website](https://www.python.org). 
We support both versions, so that should not be a problem.

Set up Python by running the file you have just downloaded. By default it will be stored on `C:\ Python27\`

Remember to check the “Add python.exe to Path” option during installation.


You will need a text editor, for example sublime, atom, vim.

##2. Register for your Africa's Talking account
To interact with the API’s, you will need to register for an account as well as generating an API Key. 
The API key is unique to you and you will need it, plus your username for any requests to our API’s.

Make sure not to lose it!

##3. Download Africa’s Talking Library
Next you will need to download the [AfricasTalkingGateway.py](http://docs.africastalking.com/smslibraries/python) to connect to our APIs.

Those are the basic requirements you need to fulfil in order to build applications and interact with our API's. 
Next we are going to send a simple SMS to make sure everything is set up right and have a first look on how to interact with the APIs.
