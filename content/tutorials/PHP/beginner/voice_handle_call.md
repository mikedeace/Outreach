##Handling a call
Handling calls made to your Africa's Talking phone is as easy as implementing a script on your web server that handles POST requests
-[POST variables Sent From Our API's](http://docs.africastalking.com/voice/callhandler#postVars)

####Simple voice application
-----------------------------
-Assuming that you have configured the callback URL for your Africa's Talking Phone Number to point to ``checkBalance.php``

```php
<?php
// Save this code in checkBalance.php. Configure the callback URL for your phone number
// to point to the location of this script on the web
// e.g http://www.myawesomesite.com/checkBalance.php

// First read in a couple of POST variables passed in with the request

// This is a unique ID generated for this call
$sessionId = $_POST['sessionId'];

// Check to see whether this call is active
$isActive  = $_POST['isActive'];

if ($isActive == 1)  {
  // Read in the caller's number. The format will contain the + in the beginning
  $callerNumber = $_POST['callerNumber'];

  // You can replace this array with an actual database table
  $balanceArr = array(
             '+254711XXXYYY' => 100,
             '+254733YYYZZZ' => 150,
             '+254711000ZZZ' => 190,
             );
  
  // Read the caller's information from the database if necessary
  if ( array_key_exists($callerNumber, $balanceArr) ) {
    $balance = $balanceArr[$callerNumber];
    $text    = "Your balance is " . $balance . " shillings. Good bye.";
  } else {
    $text = "Sorry, your phone number is not registered for this service. Good Bye.";
  }
  
  // Compose the response
  $response  = '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>';
  $response .= '<Response>';
  $response .= '<Say>'.$text.'</Say>';
  $response .= '</Response>';
   
  // Print the response onto the page so that our gateway can read it
  header('Content-type: text/plain');
  echo $response;

} else {
  
  // Read in call details (duration, cost). This flag is set once the call is completed.
  // Note that the gateway does not expect a response in thie case
  
  $duration     = $_POST['durationInSeconds'];
  $currencyCode = $_POST['currencyCode'];
  $amount       = $_POST['amount'];
  
  // You can then store this information in the database for your records

}
