###Introduction 
This tutorial will guide you on sending your first SMS in the sandbox environment.

####Prerequisites:
* We assume that you have gone through the Setup guide. If not, kindly take a look at it here [link!].
* You are registered on the sandbox[link!] and have access to either the web app or the android app.
* You have generated the API key here: https://account.sandbox.africastalking.com/settings/apikey.

###Send your first SMS
* Change directory to your ruby app folder that you created in the set up guide. We already created the sms.rb file, 
which has all the code you need to send your SMS. So just go ahead and run your sms.rb script to send SMS! ;-)

For Ubuntu
```sh

$ cd
$ cd rubyapp
$ ruby sms.rb 

```

For Windows
```sh

>cd\
>cd User
>cd YourUsername
>cd  rubyapp
>cd ruby sms.rb
