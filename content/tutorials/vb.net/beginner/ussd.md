###Introduction (Intermediate)
The USSD channel allows you to serve two way interactive content via a USSD call channel.
Users get a menu everytime they dial/interact with the USSD channel.

####Prerequisites
* We assume that you have gone through the Setup guide. If not, kindly take a look at it here [link!].
* You are registered on the sandbox[link!] and have access to either the web app or the android app.
* You have generated the API key here: https://account.sandbox.africastalking.com/settings/apikey.
* Login and navigate to https://account.sandbox.africastalking.com/ussd/createchannel to create a ussd channel.

We also expect that you either have a virtual machine online, or ar using a localhost tunneling service
like ngrok, to expose your local host to the web.

To set up on ngrok on your localhost, register for free and refer to the getting started documentation 
on https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started.

###Accessing a USSD Menu
* When the Africa's Talking API receives an incoming call on your USSD channel, a HTTP POST is sent to
your web address where your script is listening out for the post. This is your callback URL or webhook[link!]
* You receive the HTTP POST and respond to the Africa's Talking USSD server with a plain text response after
running through your logic(saving to the database, classifying the caller, fetching the callers details).
* The Africa's Talking USSD server executes the grabs the first menu from your call back URL and presents it to the user. 
Once the user chooses an option, the whole process is repeated and the user served with the menus they chose until they cancel 
the session.



## using visual studio 2013 >
> The full project is on [github](https://github.com/patrick-AT/VisualBasic-USSD-Sample)

* go to file > new > project
* in the projects window choose web under visual basic
* select *ASP.NET Web Application* and name your project as you like
* click next
* in the template window select *Empty* and ensure the *web api* check box is selected and click ok
* after your project has ben set up, locate the *Controllers* folder in your solution explorer
* right click on the *Conrolers* folder, select *Add* > *Controller*
* in the *Add Scaffold* window, select *Web API 2 Controller - Empty* and click add
* Give it a name, we will call it *MobileController*
* paste this code in the *MobileController.vb* file.

```

* build and run the solution
* tunnel the allocated port using ngrok or any other tunneling tool
* register the resulting url from ngrok as a callback in the africastalking website, append the following route **/api/mobile/ussd** before you register

* dial your ussd code
